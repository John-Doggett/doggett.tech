### Hey!
I am a CS Major specializing in machine learning, Math Major, Neuroscience Minor, and Computational Finance Minor. Yes, I know that is a lot....<br>
I am interested in Systems programming, Machine Learning, Financing modeling, and computational research in Neuroscience. 
Most of my code on my <a href="[url](https://github.com/John-Doggett)">github</a> is numerical stuff, with some scripts. 
<hr>
I am taking Operating Systems, Deeo Learing, and Probability this Spring. I am fluent in C, Python, and Java, and quite a bit of math. I am the VP for the Neurotech club at UMD.
<br>
<br>
I currently work as a sutdnet technician for the University of Maryland Instute for Advanced Computer Studies.
<br>
This summer I have a software development intership with Leidos.
