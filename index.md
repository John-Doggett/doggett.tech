### Hey!
I am a CS Major specializing in machine learning and am a Neuroscience and Math Minor. <br>
I am interested in brain-computer interfacing, as well as scientific computing. Most of my code on my [github](https://github.com/John-Doggett) is scientific computing (aproximations) related. I am taking Networking, Intro to Data Science, and two student-run classes on Ethical Hacking and Cryptocurrency this fall. I am fluent in both C and Java, and quite a bit of math. I am the VP for the Neurotech club at UMD, we are working on the NeruoTechX competition.
<br>
I currently work as a sutdnet technician for the University of Maryland Instute for Advanced Computer Studies.
